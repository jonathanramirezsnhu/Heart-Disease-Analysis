Project Goal: To predict the presence of heart disease using data like cholesterol levels, resting heart rate, chest pain.

Technology tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Scipy, Numpy.

Key Methodologies:

Data Visualization: Used Box Plots to find relationships between different factors that are affected by heart disease

Statistical Analysis: Applied hypothesis testing and T-Tests to find if there is any significant differences in things like resting heart rate, maximum heart rate during exercise
in patients with heart disease and patients without heart disease

Outcome: Identifying if heart disease affects factors like heart rate, maximum heart rate, or cholesterol levels.
